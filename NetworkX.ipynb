    "In this tutorial, we will attempt to visualize and get insights on Pittsburgh's HealthyRide bicycle network data. This data was fetched from https://healthyridepgh.com/media-kit/ and https://healthyridepgh.com/data/. For analysizing this data, we will be exploring a few libraries that help deal with network data, mapping, and data analysis. By visualizing this data, we hope to understand common ride patterns, hotspots for biking, how they relate to other biking infrastructure (bike lanes etc.), as well as other insights into trips."

    "### Libraries\n",
    "To injest and clean our data, we will be using Pandas. We will also be using it to analyze the data and perform operations such as aggregations. Pandas offers functionality to process the data, clean it, and make it usable for network analysis and other libraries. More information about Pandas can be found here: https://pandas.pydata.org/\n",
    "\n",
    "The data that we are looking at primarily involves trip information (origin, destination, time etc.). Therefore, we can best process this data in the form of a graph, and then use that graph to conduct further analysis. Python offers various graph libraries, but the most popular one with extensive documentation is networkx. More info can be found here: https://networkx.org/. It offers extensive functionality to create networks from data (including pandas dataframes) and understand properties of these networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, to visualize our data geographically, we will be using Google Maps. Google Maps has extensive inbuilt infrastructure and capabilties to represent geographical data. To use Google Maps in the Jupyter notebook, we can look to the conda gmaps library. This library has built on Google Maps API functionality to view Google Maps in a Jupyter Notebook environment. More information about this library can be found here: https://jupyter-gmaps.readthedocs.io/"
